#Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

#If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.


def find_next_square(sq):
        import math
        squared_root = math.floor(math.sqrt(sq))
        if(pow(squared_root,2)!=sq):
            return -1
        elif(pow(squared_root,2)==sq):
            next_squared = pow((squared_root+1),2)
            return next_squared
